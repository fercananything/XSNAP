Prerequisites
=============

Youâ€™ll need to know a bit of `Python <https://www.python.org>`_, `NumPy <https://numpy.org>`_, 
`Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_, `Astropy <https://www.astropy.org>`_, 
and `XSPEC <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/>`_ (or `PyXspec <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xanadu/xspec/python/html/index.html>`_). 
Please refer to each of their own documentation for details.

Additionally, a little understanding on basic astronomical `photometry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometry_(astronomy)>`_, 
`spectroscopy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy>`_, and `stellar physics <https://ads.harvard.edu/books/1989fsa..book/>`_ 
would help.
