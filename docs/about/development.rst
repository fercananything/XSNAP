         cd XSNAP
         pip install -e .

      .. code-block:: shell

         git add .
         git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"

   4. Push and open a PR against the upstream `main`:

      .. code-block:: shell

         git push origin main

      Then go to your fork on GitHub and click **“Compare & pull request”** to target ``fercananything/XSNAP:main``.

      If you prefer, feel free to send any inquiries directly to `support@xsnap.org <mailto:support@xsnap.org>`_.
